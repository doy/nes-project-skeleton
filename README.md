This is a skeleton project for building NES roms using WLA-DX. You should be
able to set the project name in the Makefile, add your code to main.s, and
then build using `make`. If you have fceux installed, `make run` will build
the project and then load the rom into fceux for testing. I've tried to
document as much as possible in comments, but feedback is very much welcome
about things that are unclear.
